Create one folder per project (e.g., PAVMOD)
Move your data on the cluster with sftp (e.g., filezilla)
Each job must be submitted with in a bash script (see examples) you need to always largely overestimate the walltime and the memory required by your job.
To mount a virtualdisk on your machine: sshfs username@129.194.96.80:/home/username  ~/mountpoint
