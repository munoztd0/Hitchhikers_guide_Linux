## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
The idea behind this website is to make available all the ressources I have gathered/created over the years make other people's life easier. 

Another purpose is to create a network of people interested in Data Science and a place for them to find information about it, so really feel free to ask for new stuff and comment on what is not working for you.

Moreover, if you are interested in the project don't hesitate to share your stuff !
